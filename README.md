# wekimini + repovizz2
This fork of the [Wekinator software](http://www.wekinator.org/) adds the extra functionality of storing and retrieving projects using the [repovizz2](https://github.com/repovizz/repovizz2doc) online repository.

## How to build
This project was built using the NetBeans IDE (version 7.4). There is a NetBeans project (within the `nbproject` folder) you can use in order to build it from scratch.

On top of the existing included packages, you will need to include the following:
* org.mortbay.jetty
* org.mortbay.jetty-util
* Java EE Web 6 API Library

(WIP)
